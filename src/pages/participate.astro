			<p>Here are the questions we‚Äôll be asking you to answer:</p>

			<ol>
				<li>
					<span class="u-text-bold">Name</span>
				</li>
				<li>
					<span class="u-text-bold">Pronouns</span> - Your identity is important
					to us.
				</li>
				<li>
					<span class="u-text-bold">Region</span> - Depending on mentor availability,
					we run teams in North America, Latin America, and Europe/Africa.
				</li>
				<li>
					<span class="u-text-bold">Time Zone</span> - Our teams are based in North
					America, Latin America (in Spanish), and European/African time zones. üåéüåç
				</li>
				<li>
					<span class="u-text-bold"
						>Do you agree to abide by The Collab Lab Code of Conduct?</span
					> - This is non-negotiable. If you want to participate, you must agree
					to follow the Code of Conduct.
				</li>
				<li>
					<span class="u-text-bold"
						>Link to a code repository (e.g., GitHub, Gitlab, Bitbucket, etc.)
						or other example of your work</span
					> - We use GitHub to host our projects, but mostly this question is about
					seeing examples of your work so feel free to point us to anything that
					represents you well. Your best bet is to link directly to a React project.
					Thanks!
				</li>
				<li>
					<span class="u-text-bold"
						>What do you hope to learn from participating in The Collab Lab?</span
					> - We take this question seriously because we want to form teams that
					are going to support and be open to learning from each other. We are interested
					in your motivations and aspirations, so help us get to know you!
				</li>
				<li>
					<span class="u-text-bold"
						>What have you done to learn coding so far?</span
					> - It‚Äôs super helpful for us to understand your coding journey. There
					is no right or wrong answer to this one!

					<p>There are two possible outcomes:</p>

					<p>üò• You get rejected. For now‚Ä¶try again!</p>
					<p>
						<span class="u-text-bold"
							>We anticipate more applicants than we will have slots.</span
						> If you‚Äôre qualified, but the numbers just didn‚Äôt work out, we‚Äôll let
						you know that and you can totally apply the next time using the same
						info. If, on the other hand, we evaluated your experience and determined
						you didn‚Äôt meet the minimum requirements in some way, we‚Äôll let you know
						that, too. That way you can put in the work to increase your chances
						of being accepted before the next application window opens.
