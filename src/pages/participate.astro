						Successful Collab Lab developers come in having already learned
						basic web development and programming concepts. We donâ€™t teach
						coding; we teach collaboration! You donâ€™t need a ton of experience,
						but
						<strong
							>you should have completed the equivalent of a coding bootcamp</strong
						>
						where youâ€™ve learned (at a minimum) basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and
						have completed a project or two in
						<a href="https://reactjs.org/">React</a>.

					<p>There are two possible outcomes:</p>
					<p>ðŸ¤— You get accepted. Yay! Weâ€™ll be in touch with next steps.</p>
					<p>ðŸ˜¥ You get rejected. For nowâ€¦try again!</p>
					<p>
						<span class="u-text-bold"
							>We anticipate more applicants than we will have slots.</span
						> If youâ€™re qualified, but the numbers just didnâ€™t work out, weâ€™ll let
						you know that and you can totally apply the next time using the same
						info. If, on the other hand, we evaluated your experience and determined
						you didnâ€™t meet the minimum requirements in some way, weâ€™ll let you know
						that, too. That way you can put in the work to increase your chances
						of being accepted before the next application window opens.
					</p>
					<p>
						All of this means <span class="u-text-bold"
							>you may have to apply multiple times</span

					<h3>Have questions?</h3>
					<p>
						If you have any questions about the application process or what itâ€™s
						like to participate in a Collab Lab cohort, please donâ€™t hesitate to
						email Andrew at andrew@the-collab-lab.codes.

					<p>
						Thank you so much for your interest in The Collab Lab! We look
