						Successful Collab Lab developers came in having already learned
						basic web development and programming concepts. We didn‚Äôt teach
						coding; we taught collaboration! While you didn‚Äôt need a ton of
						experience, we encouraged participants to have completed the
						equivalent of a coding bootcamp, where they had learned (at a
						minimum) basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and had completed a
						project or two in React.

			<p>
				While we are no longer accepting applications, here‚Äôs a look at the
				questions we previously asked prospective participants:
			</p>

			<ol>
				<li>
					<span class="u-text-bold">Name</span>
				</li>
				<li>
					<span class="u-text-bold">Pronouns</span> - Your identity is important
					to us.
				</li>
				<li>
					<span class="u-text-bold">Region</span> - Depending on mentor availability,
					we ran teams in North America, Latin America, and Europe/Africa.
				</li>
				<li>
					<span class="u-text-bold">Time Zone</span> - Our teams were based in North
					America, Latin America (in Spanish), and European/African time zones. üåéüåç
				</li>
				<li>
					<span class="u-text-bold"
						>Do you agree to abide by The Collab Lab Code of Conduct?</span
					> - This was non-negotiable. To participate, everyone had to agree to follow
					the Code of Conduct.
				</li>
				<li>
					<span class="u-text-bold"
						>Link to a code repository (e.g., GitHub, Gitlab, Bitbucket, etc.)
						or other example of your work</span
					> - We used GitHub to host our projects. This was mostly about seeing examples
					of your work, and linking to a React project was the best approach.
				</li>
				<li>
					<span class="u-text-bold"
						>What do you hope to learn from participating in The Collab Lab?</span
					> - We wanted to understand your motivations and aspirations to form teams
					that could learn and support each other.
				</li>
				<li>
					<span class="u-text-bold"
						>What have you done to learn coding so far?</span
					> - We asked this to better understand your coding journey. There was no
					right or wrong answer, just insight into your learning process.
				</li>

						for the next application window.

						This meant that participants might have needed to apply multiple
